This is the Documentation Hub for Workflows Related to Brigham Young University's Fritz B. Burns Cancer Research Mass Spectrometry Facility. Our work focus on optimizing the QC workflows of our core MS facility and improving our service to the BYU community. Our research is primarily concerned with bottom-up proteomics

This literature outlines the level of quantitative proteomics QC that we aspire to: https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00363
